            <center><h2>Hardware</h2><br></center>
            Whether it's web development, coding, scripting; you don't need any beefy requirements. For server hosting, it is recommended you do NOT host it using your personal IP address. Whether it is game hosting or web hosting, it will be a different ball game in hardware specifications if you do plan to personally host. But it is recommended, before you get into your own "homelab" to go with a dedicated server hosting platform.<br><br>
            For portability, if you are looking into using a Linux distro or Windows, I highly recommend the Lenovo Thinkpad T480. It is the last laptop in the T series that is easily upgradable. The reliability of the T series Thinkpad is unmatched and can easiliy be fetched for around $300 to $500 off eBay.

            A lot of software developers recommend a love using MacOS. In my personal opinion, I have never used MacOS for any projects. I have always stuck with Linux over Windows or MacOS. Linux and MacOS feature a traditional terminal, while Windows has command prompt as it's subsidary. For people who are interested in MacOS, the only solution I recommend is the M1 Mac Mini mainly for it's price and the powerful M1 chip that comes with the system. For $300 dollars more, you can get an M1 Macbook Air which will do the job great and you will not be spending an arm and leg to utilize an efficient Apple device. You can fetch these cheaper on Apple's website for a Apple certified refurbished model. <br><br>

            <center><h2>Operating Systems</h2><br></center>
            <h3>GNU/Linux</h3><br>
            It is highly recommended if you are getting into networking or coding to get familiar with GNU/Linux. A lot of servers are hosted on GNU/Linux and GNU/Linux is a lot of people's first choice for development. <br><br>
            Starting out can be scary, there are so many distro's to start from. You see the memes of Linux users downloading everything from terminal, or even loading videos to watch from terminal. A lot of distro's have came to be since the booming interest and popularity have came to be. Many people start out on Ubuntu, then they get a little more into it once they are more familiar. This is when they head to the Ubuntu flavors (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, etc). Eventually, they'll try Manjaro, then Fedora, and finally end the distro hopping somewhere around Gentoo and Arch Linux before they settle for one Linux distro. <br><br>
            For beginning, I recommend using Ubuntu. It comes pretty stable out of the box and features Gnome (desktop environment). Gnome DE is a great looking, snappy, customizable desktop environment, but if you don't like it, you can easily uninstall it and find something else. Xubuntu is still the same as regular Ubuntu, it features the Xfce DE which is a whole lot lighter DE than Gnome. <br><br>

            When it comes to Ubuntu, it isn't as complicated as most people think to install programs. Ubuntu features it's own Software Centre. Can't find what you're looking for there? Google your application, install the .deb package file and do it that way. Not working? Update your repository, and apt-get install from your terminal. There are many videos on Youtube to help you get started, if you want to dip your feet in before you jump in, install OracleBox VM and try it in a virtual environment for a week. You can also simply make a bootable flash drive and demo Ubuntu off the flash drive without having to format your system. <br><br>
           <h3>Code Editors and IDEs for GNU/Linux</h3><br>
           The difference between a code editor and an IDE (integrated development environment) is that a code editor is a text editing interface without the advanced features that IDEs come with. IDEs are a software development environment that features tools such as a debuggers and compilers. For code editors, I highly recommend Visual Studio Code and Atom. For IDEs, IntelliJ IDEA (for Java and Android devs) and, Eclipse (Java devs and anyone who codes in C, C++, COOL, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, Python). <br><br>
            <h3> Windows </h3><br>
            I don't really have to go in-depth here, it's easy and simple to use. Doesn't come with a terminal like MacOS or GNU/Linux. <br><br>
            If you are interested in Batch Scripting or PowerShell scripting, this is your only choice. <br><br>
